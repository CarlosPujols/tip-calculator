## Overview
This frontendmentor challenge requires an operational tip calculator. It uses information like the amount of the bill, tip percentage, which can be one of the suggested ones or a custom one, and the amount of people you're splitting the bill with. It comes with active states, and mobile design as well.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me practice my JS skills and learn some new ones. Specially handling data types from results and verifying number inputs. There's many event listeners and a lot of DOM manipulation required to complete this challenge.

### Continued development

Will follow up with methods and properties to help identify data types and proper validation from inputs as this is the task that i used most time on.
